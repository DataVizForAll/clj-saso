      <h1>The Big Disconnect: How Instructional Spending Does Not Match Student Enrollment Over Time</h1>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p class="lead">How do student enrollment and Per Pupil Instructional Spending in Hartford Region Districts change over time?</p>
         
          
          <p>According to the School and State Finance Project, out of the many formulas used to distribute funding to Connecticut public schools, "only the Education Cost Sharing (ECS) formula, which is used to fund local and regional public school districts, and the state charter school formula take student learning needs into consideration...[and] thousands of Connecticut students who attend other types of public schools are not funded by a formula that accounts for their learning needs" (“How Connecticut Funds Education.”). Due to these types of inequities, the School+State Finance Project is currently working to ensure all Connecticut students have equitable education funding.</p>
            
           <p> To explore school funding inequities more in depth, this study looks at two different types of growth in different school districts in the Hartford area over a decade: the growth of student enrollment and the growth of per pupil instructional spending. To avoid funding changes due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to use the decade from SYE 2011 to SYE 2020 rather than the most recent school years. The Report notes from the SYE 2020 data define instruction as “activities dealing directly with the interaction between teachers and students. Teaching may be provided for students in a school classroom or in another location” (Report Notes). The Report notes also define instruction support services as “activities assisting the instructional staff with the content and process of providing learning experiences for students not reported as Improving Instruction or Library and media service” (Report Notes).</p>

          <p> One might predict that as more students enroll in a school, classes might increase in size and as a result more instructional funding would be needed to account for students’ different learning needs. However, the findings from this study suggest otherwise in the period from school year ending in 2011 to school year ending in 2020. To investigate how the number of students being educated in each district and how per student instruction and instruction support service funding have changed over this decade, we used the percentage changes between the two school years.</p>

          <p>Only six school districts had an increase in enrollment count, four of which (Achievement Hartford Academy District, Capitol Region Education Council, Odyssey Community School District, and Jumoke District Academy) had a tremendous percentage increase of over 50%. These four districts also all happen to be choice districts– three (Achievement Hartford Academy District, Odyssey Community School District, and Jumoke District Academy) are charter districts and one (Capitol Region Education Council) is a magnet district.</p>		   
          
          <p>It is noteworthy as well that all other districts have percentage change values that are less than 10%. However, looking at the numbers more closely from year to year you may notice that some increases are much smaller than others. For example, the Odyssey Community School District increased from only 181 students to 329 students in the last decade while the Capitol Region Education Council had a much larger increase in student count, jumping from 4,646 students to 8,657 students. Still, both districts have a similar growth of about 80 percent increase during the decade. </p>
          
          <p> You can explore the data further by looking at the table in Figure 2. The columns from left to right are as follows: school districts, the SYE 2011 student count, the SYE 2020 student count, and bar charts displaying the percentage changes for each district. The table has also been sorted from highest to lowest percentage change and there is a feature which allows you to search for different districts.</p>

          <p>The funding data showed that percentage change in enrollment numbers is not proportional to percentage change in instructional funding. Achievement Hartford Academy District, Odyssey Community School District, and Jumoke District Academy fell among the four districts with the least percentage change in instructional funding over the years. Additionally, the Capitol Region Education Council had the largest percentage increase in instructional funding among all the districts. Thus, where the growth happened in instructional spending was almost the opposite of where the growth happened for student enrollment numbers. </p>

<p> See Figure 3 for more details. Similar to the first table, this second table has the following columns: school districts, SYE 2011 instructional funding amount, SYE 2020 instructional funding amount, and bar charts displaying the percentage changes for each district (the rows also sorted by these values only now from smallest to largest), and also has a search feature.	</p>

          <h2>A Relationship Between Enrollment and Instructional Spending?</h2>   
        
         <p> In order to explore the relationship between these two variables further, a scatter plot was created. The plot has the student count percentage change on the x-axis, the instructional spending percentage change on the y-axis, and each point represents a different school district (See Figure 4). The plot has four clear outliers which are far from the rest of the data: Capitol Region Education Council, Achievement Hartford Academy District, Odyssey Community School District, and Jumoke District Academy. These findings raise further questions about whether per pupil instructional funding is distributed equitably among students in the Hartford Region. </p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p> To see changes in student enrollment over a decade, I chose to gather the data for SYE 2011 (school year ending in) to SYE 2020 from the <a href="https://public-edsight.ct.gov/students/enrollment-dashboard?language=en_US">Edsight Enrollment dashboard</a>. I downloaded the data as two Excel files and imported them into Google Drive. To clean the data, I filtered through using VLOOKUP so that only the Hartford Region districts’ data would be displayed. Then, in a new column, I calculated the percentage change from SYE 2011 to SYE 2020 (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14PCQIvpNNMq2quuUGxPkGgV1R528avzMYwoCNn_mMI4/edit?usp=sharing ">Emiko's Build 4 question 1 data</a>). For instructional funding, I used data from the Per Pupil Expenditures Edsight page. I gathered the data from SYE 2011 and SYE 2020 and compiled it into a spreadsheet (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QJ_JMUCBJx7PAKglETGc2EX8gWVly5H8ffqEnBBPA-A/edit?usp=sharing">Emiko's Build 4 question 2 data</a>). The two tables and scatter plot were all created with <a href="https://www.datawrapper.de/">DataWrapper</a>. To account for instructional spending, I summed up multiple values from the given data. A note of caution– due to a change in data formatting on the Edsight website from before 2016-2017 to after 2017-2018, column names were different so the Instructional per pupil expenditure for SYE 2011 is made up of “Instructional Staff and Services,” “Instructional Supplies and Equipment,” and “Instruction and Educational Media Services,” while Instructional per pupil expenditure for SYE 2020 is made up of “Instruction” and “Instruction Support Services Values.” Additionally, while the expenditure data from SYE 2020 had a report with specific definitions for instructional funding and other related columns, the expenditure data from SYE 2011 did not have a clear report with definitions for its differing column names. </p>
